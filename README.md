## Questions
- how should we test our updates? Currently doing ```npm unlink ``` and ```npm link```
- what structure should I use?
- Do we still have user stories?
- What would be the difference between using streams and callbacks?
- What is the purpose of ```toMatchSnapshot```
- I tried to use jest.fn trying to mock got module, but I had problems lbecause it was not being called, the I replaced that with jest.mock and make it return a function it actually worked, but id on not know why.

## Insights
Even Jest documentation is great...
It is hard to **figure out where to start**
